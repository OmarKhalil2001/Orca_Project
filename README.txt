Orca is an Android App/Website that have purpose of helping users increase
the positivity in their lives using simple real-life activities. The app was
uses a scoring system where every time you complete a task you level up and earn
ranks until you become a "Killer Orca".

The system was built using HTML, CSS, JQuery, JavaScript, and Processing.Js. I used HTML and CSS
for basic structure and design, JavaScript for user interaction, JQuery for basic animations, and
Processing.JS for more complicated animations. I also used Adobe PhoneGap to turn the website into
an Android Application.

The whole system was inspired by the "Blue Whale" Challenge and the desire to make the world a better
place :).
